    "# Client Credentials Flow\n",
    "Unlike other flows, there are some differences to note about Client Credentials Flow:\n",
    "- It does not go through the authorization (`authorize`) endpoint\n",
    "    - Instead it directly request a token from the `token` endpoint using the application's `client_secret`\n",
    "- It does not require user interaction/input\n",
    "- It is most often used in Server-To-Server or Service-To-Service (STS) scenarios\n",
    "    - Background services and daemons that usually do not interact with users.\n",
    "- The application is no longer impersonating a user, instead is using it's own identity\n",
    "- Refresh tokens are never granted with this flow, since the resource can alway get another one using it's credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "> [!WARNING] âš  Since this flow uses the client credentials, you must make sure not to expose them within your code, else a possibly not so friendly user might use them as well to login as that identity!"
