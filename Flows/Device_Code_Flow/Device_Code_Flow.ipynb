    "# Device Code Flow\n",
    "The Device Code Flow uses the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant. It is meant to be used by IoT type devices (such as Smart TVs) that lack a browser or are input constrained.\n",
    "> [!NOTE] This flow requires user interaction in a separate device.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works!?\n",
    "1. The device first sends a POST request to the `/devicecode` endpoint with it's `client_id` and the `scope` is requesting.\n",
    "2. The response has the `message` which instructs the user to go to the `verification_uri` along with the `user_code` which the user will need to input in a different device to authenticate and authorize the scope for that device.\n",
    "3. The `device_code`, is also returned as a parameter in the response and is used in a follow up POST request by the device, this time to the `/token` endpoint.\n",
    "4. After the initial POST in step (3) request, the device will continue to poll (send requests)  `/token` endpoint until it receives a `200` (after a successful user login and consent of scope(s)) including the token(s) or a different error like scope issues, the user not logging or the flow not supported for that application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual of Device Code Flow\n",
    "See the `Device_Code_Flow.md` for a visual representation using mermaid.\n",
    "\n",
    "---   \n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "To execute this flow, you must turn on \"Allow public client flows\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a how to do this:\n",
    "1. Got to Azure Portal\n",
    "2. Entra ID > App registrations\n",
    "3. Select your application\n",
    "4. Under Manage select Authentication\n",
    "5. In Advanced settings towards the bottom, you have \"**Allow public client flows**\" \n",
    "6. Turn the switch on to \"Yes\" to the right of \"Enable the following mobile and desktop flows:\""
